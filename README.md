# ArcadeRumble
Meant to be the successor to Blind Rumble, but never released.

This mod puts the player in double-third-person mode (sixth-person mode?), controlling themselves from an arial view that they see on the screen of an arcade machine. It was meant to simulate an arcade-era fighting game,and since it was based on a RUMBLE video I made, it's also pretty dear to me. This mod was also going to launch with a trailer, so I've put the incomplete version of it in this repo.

I believe `cameratest` is the asset bundle file.
